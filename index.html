                                        I was born in Glasgow, Scotland. My father is Scottish, and my mother is
                                        English. As
                                        a child I moved between Scotland and England numerous times
                                        which resulted in an interrupted education. I completed my high school education
                                        in
                                        Cambridge, England in 1992. After completing
                                        high school, I managed to get a job as a database programmer using a technology
                                        that
                                        I don’t think exists anymore named dBase.
                                        In 1994 I emigrated to Perth, Australia with my family and have lived in Perth
                                        ever
                                        since. After arriving in Perth, I studied
                                        various industry certifications, including Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer,
                                        Cisco Certified Network Associate, VMware Certified
                                        Professional, NetApp Certified Storage Administrator, EMC Storage, EMC Avamar
                                        and
                                        Hitachi Storage Systems. I live with my wife and
                                        two youngest children, the older two live on their own now. I have a passion for
                                        fast
                                        motorcycles and currently own a BMW S1000 RR which
                                        is pictured below. I will often spend full days out on country roads with my
                                        bike,
                                        pushing it and myself to the limits.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The maximum speed I have had this bike up to is 317 KM/h on a racetrack which I
                                        don’t
                                        recommend to anyone that doesn’t want their whole
                                        body, especially their neck to hurt for 2 weeks afterwards. It takes a lot of
                                        physical effort to hold on and your head bounces
                                        around like a punch ball.

                            <p>
                                My interest in IT first started at the age of 10 when my father bought me a BBC Micro
                                and a subscription to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_(magazine)"
                                                     target="_blank">Input magazine.
                            </a>The magazine ran for 1 year between 1984 and 1985 and produced 52 weekly installments.
                                It taught readers how to program in both basic and 8-bit assembly language. I found
                                these both particularly easy to pick up and was soon programming my own simple games.
                                From that point on I have had a huge interest in writing programs that make life
                                easier for me. Since 2003, I have been employed in the infrastructure side of IT,
                                working with everything from endpoints through to enterprise level storage,
                                virtualisation, networking, and servers. As part of my experience in infrastructure,
                                I have been involved in datacentre installations, monitoring, and maintaining hardware
                                and software, project implementations and design work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I chose to come to RMIT because I wanted to head back down the programming path and
                                couldn’t get directly into university because my last official education was in 1992. I
                                approached OUA who advised taking the first 2 units of the Bachelor of IT, then enrol in
                                the Bachelor of IT if I pass them. This course was chosen as it had a reasonable amount
                                of programming in it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During my studies I am hoping to get a grounding in programming again. I have not done
                                much of that in the last 10 years and am very rusty. I am also interested to see how
                                others learn and work in teams. Once I complete the Bachelor of IT I would like to
                                continue official education in programming.

                                either of them.

                                will complete the Bachelor of IT, then pursue further study in the field of programming.
                                While I am obtaining the qualifications that I require, I will start creating mobile
                                applications to begin creating a portfolio.

                                        After completing and reviewing  the results of the tests, I can say that in
                                        relation to me, they are about 80% correct. The Myer-Briggs results show that I
                                        am introverted with intuitive, thinking, and prospecting traits. I enjoy
                                        thinking about things in depth, no matter what the subject. As stated, I do love
                                        to analyse patterns and notice discrepancies which at times makes me feel like I
                                        have obsessive compulsive disorder. I am and have always been a person that
                                        prefers to learn by doing. I am not satisfied knowing that if I tick the box, it
                                        will fix the issue, I want to know what ticking the box does "under the hood". I
                                        have been a team leader in my roles in the IT industry and have proven to be
                                        good at the role. I have always been very good at learning and understanding
                                        technology, to the point where I have also been technical leads in various
                                        different areas of IT, which is in line with what the team roles test indicates.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I think these results may influence by behaviour in a team where I will try and
                                        assume a lead role, whether that be as a team lead or a technical lead.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When forming a team, I should take this into account so that the team is not top
                                        heavy with similar team members and look for members that can fill other roles
                                        that compliment mine rather than compete against them.

                            <h5>Overview:</h5>
                            <p>
                                The project is to create a mobile application for some doctor’s services. This will
                                provide a convenient and more time friendly way for people without emergencies to
                                interact with the local General Practitioner. There may also be a benefit of reducing
                                the cost of the consultations due to efficiency. The application will provide video and
                                audio consultations, blood pressure readings, weight, and body mass data to the doctor.
                                This information will be obtained through the use of external devices such as a smart
                                watch and smart scales. It will allow prescriptions and referrals to be sent
                                electronically and provide an online booking service.

                            </p>
                            <h5>Motivation:</h5>
                            <p>
                                I have many medical conditions that require medical appointments with my GP. Around 65%
                                of my visits are for prescriptions or blood pressure checks. When I attend the surgery,
                                I can wait anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour just to see the doctor. Once I get called
                                by the doctor, I am out again in 10 minutes or under. If I include the time to travel to
                                and from the surgery, it can take up to 2 hours of my day for a simple appointment.
                                I have a few friends who do not live in the metropolitan area who also must travel more
                                than 20 KM to see their doctor.
                                I believe a mobile app like this will reduce the need to visit the doctor, save time and
                                free the doctor’s surgery up for more pressing appointments.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Description</h5>
                            <p>
                                The product will be a mobile application that will run on Android or iOS. It will
                                integrate with smart watches and smart scales. The features will include the following:
                                <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong><u>Online booking service</u></strong> – This will allow the patient to book appointments with the
                                    doctor and select what the appointment is for at the time of booking. This is like
                                    other applications on the market.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong><u>Video and audio appointments</u></strong> – There will be an option to book a video or audio
                                    appointment with the doctor, although this will not be a requirement if the patient
                                    is requesting services that do not require immediate contact.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong><u>Blood pressure</u></strong> – Blood pressure will be monitored via a smart watch and relayed back
                                    to the application. At the time of booking, this will be requested and sent to the
                                    doctor.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong><u>Weight and body mass</u></strong> – There are two methods in which this can be collected, the
                                    first is using smart scales and the second is using a smart watch that provides the
                                    feature. Both methods will relay the information to the application and send it to
                                    the doctor at the time of the booking.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong><u>Prescriptions</u></strong> – Prescriptions can be requested via the app if the patient is
                                    currently taking the requested medication. Once prepared, the prescription can be
                                    sent directly to a pharmacy or sent electronically to the patient to print out and
                                    present at a pharmacy.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong><u>Referrals</u></strong> – A doctor will be able to raise a referral for the patient and send it
                                    electronically to the place of referral or to the patient to print at home.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong><u>ECG</u></strong> - The latest smart watches such as the Samsung Galaxy Watch4 is capable of ECG
                                    monitoring and is registered with the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. This
                                    data can also be sent to the doctor when requested.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong><u>Historic data and trending</u></strong> – Monitoring blood pressure, weight, ECG data, and body
                                    mass electronically will allow for trending and reference points for the doctor
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The doctor will be able to perform all his/her operations on the application either via
                                the mobile application or via a secure web page.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The backend for the application would involve clustered application and database servers
                                with an API written in PHP, fault tolerant storage and network load balancers. To ensure
                                the privacy of the patients, only doctors will have access to patient data and that will
                                be gained via 2 factor authentication across encrypted tunnels between the client and
                                the server. The infrastructure will be housed in a secure datacentre, with hourly
                                backups be performed using a disk to disk to cloud method.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This application will be useful to individuals who must travel significant distances to
                                go to their doctor or have mobility issues because it will reduce the time of visits and
                                the frequency of required physical visits. In addition to these benefits, it will also
                                benefit time poor individuals who put off visits because they are busy.
                            </p>

                            <h5>Outcome:</h5>
                            <p>If the project is successful, there will be full working infrastructure to support the
                                application, the application will be complete and thoroughly tested. There will be push
                                to sign up doctors surgeries, specialists and pharmacies so people can start using it to
                                their advantage.

                                A successful project will lead to easier interaction with doctors for patients, patients
                                will have greater access, time will be saved, doctors will be able to serve more
                                patients than before, and the burden on GP waiting rooms will have been reduced.
