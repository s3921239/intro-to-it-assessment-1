                                        I was born in Glasgow, Scotland. My father is Scottish, and my mother is
                                        English. As
                                        a child I moved between Scotland and England
                                        which resulted in an interrupted education. I completed my high school education
                                        in
                                        Cambridge, England in 1992. After, completing
                                        high school, I managed to get a job as a database programmer using a technology
                                        that
                                        I don’t even think exists anymore named dBase.
                                        In 1994 I emigrated to Perth, Australia with my family and have lived in Perth
                                        ever
                                        since. After arriving in Perth, I studied
                                        various industry certifications, including Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer,
                                        Cisco Certified Network Associate, VMware Certified
                                        Professional, NetApp Certified Storage Administrator, EMC Storage, EMC Avamar
                                        and
                                        Hitachi Storage Systems. I live with my wife and
                                        two youngest kids, the older two live on their own now. I have a passion for
                                        fast
                                        motorcycles and currently own a BMW S1000 RR which
                                        is pictured below. I will often spend full days out on country roads with my
                                        bike,
                                        pushing it and myself to the limits.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The maximum speed I have had this bike at is 317 KM/h on a racetrack which I
                                        don’t
                                        recommend to anyone that doesn’t want their whole
                                        body, especially their neck to hurt for 2 weeks afterwards. It takes a lot of
                                        physical effort to hold on and your heads bounces
                                        around like a punch ball.

                            <p>
                                My interest in IT first started at the age of 10 when my father bought me a BBC Micro
                                and
                                a subscription to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_(magazine)"
                                                     target="_blank">Input magazine.
                            </a>The magazine ran for 1 year between 1984 and 1985 and produced 52 weekly installments.
                                It taught you how to program in both basic and 8-bit assembly language. I found these
                                both
                                particularly easy to pick up and was soon programming my own simple games. From that
                                point on I have had a huge interest in writing programs that make life easier for me.
                                Since
                                2003, I have been employed in the infrastructure side of IT, working with everything
                                from
                                endpoints through to enterprise level storage, virtualisation, networking, and servers.
                                As part of my experience in infrastructure, I have been involved in datacentre
                                installations, monitoring, and maintaining hardware and software, project
                                implementations and design work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I chose to come to RMIT because I wanted to head back down the programming path and
                                couldn’t get directly into university because my last official education was in 1992. I
                                approached OUA who advised taking the first 2 units of the Bachelor of IT, then enrol in
                                the Bachelor of IT if I pass them. This course was chosed as it had a reasonable amount
                                of programming in it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During my studies I am hoping to get a grounding in programming again. I have not done
                                much of that in the last 10 years and am very rusty. I am also interested to see how
                                others
                                learn and work in teams. Once I complete the Bachelor of IT I would like to continue
                                official education in programming.

                                will complete the Bachelor of IT, then pursue further study in the field of programming.
                                While I am obtaining the qualifications that I require, I will start creating mobile
                                applications to begin creating a portfolio.

                                        After completing and review the results of the tests, I can say that in relation
                                        to me, they are about 80% correct. They Myer-Briggs results show that I am an
                                        introverted with intuitive, thinking, and prospecting traits. I enjoy thinking
                                        about things in depth, no matter what the subject. As stated, I do love to analyse
                                        patterns and notice discrepancies which at times makes me feel like I have
                                        obsessive compulsive disorder. I am and have always been a person that prefers
                                        to learn by doing. I am not satisfied knowing that if I tick the box, it will
                                        fix the issue, I want to know what ticking the box does "under the hood". I have
                                        been a team leader in my roles in the IT industry and have proven to be good at the
                                        role. I have always been very good at learning and understanding technology, to
                                        the point where I have also been technical leads in various different areas of
                                        IT, which is in line with what the team roles test indicates.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I think these results may influence by behaviour in a team where I will try and
                                        assume a lead role, whether that be as a team lead or a technical lead.

                                    <p>
                                        When forming a team, I should take this into account so that the team is not top
                                        heavy with similar team members and look for members that can fill other roles
                                        that compliment mine rather than compete against them.

                            <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the
                            collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These
                            classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
                            transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables.
                            It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
                            <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
