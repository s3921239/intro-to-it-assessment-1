                                    I was born in Glasgow, Scotland.  My father is Scottish, and my mother is English.
                                    As a child I moved between Scotland and England which resulted in an interrupted education.
                                    I completed my high school education in Cambridge, England in 1992.  After, completing high school,
                                    I managed to get a job as a database programmer using a technology that I don’t even think exists anymore named dBase.
                                    In 1994 I emigrated to Perth, Australia with my family and have lived in Perth ever since.  After arriving in Perth,
                                    I studied various industry certifications, including Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer, Cisco Certified Network Associate,
                                    VMware Certified Professional, NetApp Certified Storage Administrator, EMC Storage, EMC Avamar and Hitachi Storage Systems.

                                    I live with my wife and two youngest kids, the older two live on their own now.
                                    I have a passion for fast motorcycles and currently own a BMW S1000 RR which is pictured below.
                                    I will often spend full days out on country roads with my bike, pushing it and myself to the limits.
                                    The maximum speed I have had this bike at is 317 KM/h on a racetrack which I don't recommend to anyone
                                    that doesn't want their whole body, especially neck to hurt for 2 weeks afterwards.  It takes a lot of
                                    physical effort to hold on and your head bounces around like a punch ball.

                            <p>My interest in IT first started at the age of 10 when my father bought me a BBC Micro and a subscription to
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_(magazine)" target="_blank">Input magazine</a>. The magazine ran for 1 year between 1984 and 1985 and produced
                            52 weekly installments.
                            It taught you how to program in both basic and 8-bit assembly language.  I found these both particularly easy to pick up and was
                            soon programming my own simple games.  From that point on I have had a huge interest in writing programs that make life easier for me.
                            Since 2003 I have been employed in the infrastructure side of IT, working with everything from endpoints through to enterprise
                            level storage, virtualisation, networking and servers.  As part of my experience in infrastructure, I have been involved in datacentre
                            installations, monitoring, and maintaining hardware and software, project implementations and design work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            I chose to come to RMIT because I wanted to head back down the programming path and couldn’t get directly into university because
                            my last official education was in 1992.  I approached OUA who advised taking the first 2 units of the Bachelor of IT which is
                            run at RMIT, then enrol in the Bachelor of IT if I pass them.  This course was chosen as it had a reasonable amount of programming in it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            During my studies I am hoping to get a grounding in programming again.  I have not done much of that in the last 10 years and am
                            very rusty.  I am also interested to see how others learn and work in teams.  Once I complete the Bachelor of IT I would like to
                            continue official education in programming.

                            <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
