                                    I was born in Glasgow, Scotland. My father is Scottish, and my mother is English. As
                                    a child I moved between Scotland and England
                                    which resulted in an interrupted education. I completed my high school education in
                                    Cambridge, England in 1992. After, completing
                                    high school, I managed to get a job as a database programmer using a technology that
                                    I don’t even think exists anymore named dBase.
                                    In 1994 I emigrated to Perth, Australia with my family and have lived in Perth ever
                                    since. After arriving in Perth, I studied
                                    various industry certifications, including Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer,
                                    Cisco Certified Network Associate, VMware Certified
                                    Professional, NetApp Certified Storage Administrator, EMC Storage, EMC Avamar and
                                    Hitachi Storage Systems. I live with my wife and
                                    two youngest kids, the older two live on their own now. I have a passion for fast
                                    motorcycles and currently own a BMW S1000 RR which
                                    is pictured below. I will often spend full days out on country roads with my bike,
                                    pushing it and myself to the limits.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The maximum speed I have had this bike at is 317 KM/h on a racetrack which I don’t
                                    recommend to anyone that doesn’t want their whole
                                    body, especially their neck to hurt for 2 weeks afterwards. It takes a lot of
                                    physical effort to hold on and your heads bounces
                                    around like a punch ball.
